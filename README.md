_BUT please be patient and wait while the notebook loads! This is a large set of complex software that takes a while to boot up on MyBinder._

## How this works

This project uses [a version of the AMI3 tools that embeds all dependencies in the Docker container](https://github.com/anjackson/ami3) and adds support for [using the tools on MyBinder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/dockerfile.html). This allows the ContentMine tools to be run in your browser via a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

It also includes a [copy](./dictionaries) of the [openVirus](https://github.com/petermr/openVirus) dictionaries.ami-search -p ethos-sample --dictionary=virus_topics --dictionary=viral_systemic_diseases
