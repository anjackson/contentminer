    "I'm trying find theses and articles that refer to Coronavirus etc by running ami-search over them with the openVirus dictionaries. I have fulltext.pdf files, but I believe I need scholarly.html files to run ami-search (it says it can't find any text).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks - these are wonderful questions. No need to apologize.\n",
    "AMI has been built in an ad hoc fashion from a variety of projects and\n",
    "often not finished. So I tested that GROBID worked but at that stage no one\n",
    "was interested in using it. I'll hack ami-Grobid to output scholarly.html.\n",
    "Hoping that everything will move to using something similar to JATS (which\n",
    "has a subset of HTML)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Thanks, that's very helpful! I get meaningful results after doing a cp\n",

    "\n",
    " I'm happy trying things out and handling conversions.\n",

    "start is my slides\n",
    "https://www.slideshare.net/petermurrayrust/text-and-data-mining-explained-at-ftdm\n",
    "and a lot of other similar ones\n",
    " The bit I'm struggling with is the overall workflow stages and any\n",
    " constraints on how the data is suppose to be. Example questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The OCR/Grobid workflows appear to target the generation of\n",
    "    scholarly.html but the current AMI3 project requires me to pick one\n",
    "    workflow and copy the result into place as scholarly.html, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "I will try to hack grobid tonight.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Am I right to think that ami-search works happily with plain text\n",
    "    fulltext.pdf.txt or HTML scholarly.html, but nothing else?\n",
    "\n",
    " I think so\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Will any reasonable plain text or HTML representation suffice? (e.g\n",
    "    at first I thought scholarly.html was referring to this proposal\n",
    "    <https://w3c.github.io/scholarly-html/> but I think not?)\n",
    "\n",
    " Any Html will work as long as its well-formed - I think. Scholarly HTML\n",
    "hasn't really taken off and I think the HTML subset in JATS will work.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It seems ami-search generates plain XML - how does this relate to\n",
    "    generating WikiData content?\n",
    "\n",
    " AMI search uses Wikidata. It doesn't currently generate Wikidata.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - I think ami-search takes keywords relating to specific concepts\n",
    "    (dictionaries) and records where they appear in a set of texts, right?\n",
    "\n",
    " Yes, absolutely.\n",
