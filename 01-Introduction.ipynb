    "    This <a href=\"https://jupyter.org/\">Juypter Notebook</a> provide an interactive environment where you can run Python scripts and shell commands and see the results in your browser.<br/>\n",
    "    For shell commands, each line starts with a <tt>!</tt>, so <tt>!echo hello</tt> runs a shell script, but <tt>print('hello')</tt> runs as Python.<br/>\n",

    "### The Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "The vison that drives ContentMine is that text and data mining should be used to open up all research literature, allowing the factual content to be made available to all, and helping researchers to make better use of what has already been discovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The high-level workflow for meeting this vision works as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a research question or area of interest:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collect all relevant publications:\n",
    "    - This may be as PDF files or as XML or HTML.\n",
    "- Normalise the publications into a better machine-readable form:\n",
    "    - As well-structured HTML, referred to here as 'scholarly HTML' (but note that this does _not_ refer to [the proposed Scholarly HTML standard](https://w3c.github.io/scholarly-html/)). Any properly marked-up HTML should work fine, but ideally re-using the subset of [JATS](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/) tags that make sense in a HTML context.\n",
    "    - If HTML isn't an option, plain text can be used.\n",
    "    - However, depending on the question at hand, other formats might be required.\n",
    "- Extract facts:\n",
    "    - Which papers mention which terms and concepts?\n",
    "    - What research cited in each paper?\n",
    "    - Which chemical compounds appear in the diagrams of each paper.\n",
    "- Share the results:\n",
    "    - Make the normalised publications available (if licensing permits).\n",
    "    - Make the extracted facts openly available (factual assertions and [non-consumptive datasets](https://www.hathitrust.org/htrc_ncup) can usually be made available without restriction).\n",
    "    - Create visualisations and documentation to help understand the results.\n",
    "- Make new knowledge:\n",
    "    - Use the results as the foundation for your own research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, however, we'll focus on a specific use case and use that to explore how the approach works."

    "In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, the [openVirus project](https://github.com/petermr/openVirus#openvirus) aims to aggregate scholarly publications and extracted knowledge on viruses and epidemics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll look at the specific case of finding which open access electronic theses mention terms relating to viruses and epidemics. Information about UK e-theses has been gathered by the [EThOS service](https://ethos.bl.uk/), and a suitable source dataset has been made available [here](https://data.bl.uk/ethos/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific workflow here is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the EThOS dataset to find open-access theses.\n",
    "- Get the PDFs and assemble them into the file folder layout conventions of the ContentMine toolkit.\n",
    "- Generate HTML or text versions of the PDFs.\n",
    "- Search through the HTML for the relevant terms, and extract the terms along with snippets of text as context for each time the terms appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The openVirus project has already created some [dictionaries](https://github.com/petermr/openVirus/tree/master/dictionaries) that can be used to link the terms that appear in the text to the relevant WikiData entities. _TBA come back to dictionary creation later on_\n",
    "\n",
    "But to get started, we need some data sources. We'll start with a single theses, found by searching EThOS for relevant terms: [TraVerse : a method of natural respiratory virus transmission from symptomatic children to healthy young adults](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.755301) (`id: uk.bl.ethos.755301`)\n",
